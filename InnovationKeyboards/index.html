<!--Here's a note from the person who spent over 40 hours working on this:

	I will say this over and over. Don't insult my table. I can write you an essay on the horrors of trying to memorize
	every fricken tag along with the order it needs to be put in. I swear, those things never end.
	
	Btw, thanks for actually being one of those people who look at the Inspect. You're probobly only doing it to make fun of my website 
	and make it say stupid stuff, but thanks anyways. As I may have mentioned before, it took me a while to get all this done.

            Why do people buy a custom keyboard? Most may think custom keyboards are a waste of money.
            “You can just buy one for ten bucks at a store, why pay more?” A keyboard, such an ordinary thing in our
            lives, yet we use it
            almost all day long. The average American spends at least three hours typing each day, which adds up to over
            1,000 hours typing a year.
            <br><br>
            What if you could get a keyboard that could improve your accurcay, raise your typing speed and even be
            custom designed for you as a bonus?
            What if you could get a keyboard that suited your exact needs in school, home and entertainment?
            <br><br>

		Oh, and here's something funny for you. Oliver was being annoying, well, more annoying than usual so I posted this:-->
    <!--Bob is following you.
        <br>
        Oliver's response: Ur Mom is following you.
        <br>
		After that he spammed me with screaming emails to take it down, so it's in the comments. . . for now.

        We buy the materials:</p>

    <!--Materials List-->

    <ul>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">The base</span> is the bottom of the keybard, and is what holds all the keys in
            place and determines the sizing of the keyboard. They can come in a variety of different colors, sizes, and
            materials.</li>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">The PCB</span> is the electronics inside of the keyboard.</li>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">The plate</span> is the part which mounts the switches and plays a big role in the
            pitch of the board, and how stiff or soft it is.<br> </li>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">The switches</span> determine the spring feel such as the bump, smoothness, and
            weight of the springs.</li>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">The stabilizers</span> go on all keys bigger than two units wide. The keeyp the
            bigger keys, such as the space bar, or the shift key from wobbling.</li>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">The keycaps</span> are the phyisical keys you press on top of the switches. They
            are responsible for the color and aesthetics as well as altering the sound of the keybaord.</li>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">Lube</span> is used to makes switches smoother, and reduce rattle in the
            stabelizers. A regular keyboard typically uses 2-3 different kinds of lube.</li>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">Foam</span> is used to dampen the sound of the keyboard, and reduces hollow sound
            from keypress.</li>
        <li><span class="fancy-words">Films</span> are small plastic foam squares that are wedged between the top and
            bottom of a switch to reduce wobble and alter sound in the keys.</li>
    </ul>
