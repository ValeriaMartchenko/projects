            Why do people buy a custom keyboard? Most may think custom keyboards are a waste of money.
            “You can just buy one for ten bucks at a store, why pay more?” A keyboard, such an ordinary thing in our
            lives, yet we use it
            almost all day long. The average American spends at least three hours typing each day, which adds up to over
            1,000 hours typing a year.
            <br><br>
            What if you could get a keyboard that could improve your accurcay, raise your typing speed and even be
            custom designed for you as a bonus?
            What if you could get a keyboard that suited your exact needs in school, home and entertainment?
