<!--Here's a note from the person who spent over 40 hours working on this:

	I will say this over and over. Don't insult my table. I can write you an essay on the horrors of trying to memorize
	every fricken tag along with the order it needs to be put in. I swear, those things never end.
	
	Btw, thanks for actually being one of those people who look at the Inspect. You're probobly only doing it to make fun of my website 
	and make it say stupid stuff, but thanks anyways. As I may have mentioned before, it took me a while to get all this done.
