<!--Here's a note from the person who spent over 40 hours working on this:

	I will say this over and over. Don't insult my table. I can write you an essay on the horrors of trying to memorize
	every fricken tag along with the order it needs to be put in. I swear, those things never end.
	
	Btw, thanks for actually being one of those people who look at the Inspect. You're probobly only doing it to make fun of my website 
	and make it say stupid stuff, but thanks anyways. As I may have mentioned before, it took me a while to get all this done.

                Paper laptops have always been the best way to take notes, learn, and have fun without an electronic
                computer, the
                only problem was finding authentic quality made ones for cheaper than $5. Here, at InnovationKeybaords,
                we create
                artisanal, fully handmade, paper laptops to improve your school and work experience. Our owner is an
                experienced
                paper laptop artisan and has over 4 years of experience.
                <br><br>
                Our paper laptops are no-nonsense, while they are made of paper, that doesn't mean we put on a keyboard
                and
                pretend to type on it, these are made to be reusable infinitely and serve an actual function rather than
                just
                a toy, along with making school less boring.
                <br><br>
                In fact, we are so confident in our products, If you are ever not satisfied with your paper laptop, just
                hand
                it back in for a full refund as long as it is withing 7 days, and in good condition.

		Oh, and here's something funny for you. Oliver was being annoying, well, more annoying than usual so I posted this:-->
        <!--Bob is following you.
        <br>
        Oliver's response: Ur Mom is following you.
        <br>
		After that he spammed me with screaming emails to take it down, so it's in the comments. . . for now.
