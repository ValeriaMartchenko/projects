        What even are paper laptops? Well, that is a question that for centuries, even the wisest of philosophers could
        not figure out. On the other hand, there is one thing we know about paper laptops, and that is that they are the
        thing that make us wonder, they are the very source of all imagination in this world, all creativity. Paper
        laptops, in a way, represent a sort of inspiration, the inspiration to learn, to work, to live. They represent
        humanity at its peak, the combination of centuries of work, all in a few sheets of paper. Paper laptops answer
        the big questions, why are we here? What is our purpose?
        <br><br>
                You never really own a paper laptop; you merely use it until you inevitably throw it away. You never experience a paper
                laptop; you only dream of doing so. The hardest part in it all is to find a paper laptop that accomplishes all this, a
                paper laptop that is artisanal and handmade, a paper laptop made with care and passion, a paper laptop made by someone
                with over 4 years of experience. Now that is something incredibly hard to find. Most would give up, but not you. You
                have found the source, the source of the world, the soul, and that is right here, our paper laptops.
